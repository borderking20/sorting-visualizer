# sorting-visualizer
Introduction
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This application is designed to help users understand various sorting algorithms through visual representation. Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in computer science, and visualizing their operation can greatly aid in learning and comprehension. This project visualizes the step-by-step process of different sorting techniques, making it easier for users to grasp the underlying concepts.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualize a variety of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Step-by-Step Animation: Watch the sorting process unfold step-by-step, highlighting the key operations and transitions.
Customizable Array Size: Adjust the size of the array to see how the algorithms handle different input sizes.
Speed Control: Modify the speed of the visualization to suit your learning pace.
Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface that allows for easy interaction and control of the visualization process.

Usage
Select a Sorting Algorithm: Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the options provided.
Generate Array: Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array of a specified size.
Adjust Settings: Use the sliders to change the array size and the speed of the animation.
Start Visualization: Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array step-by-step.

Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: Divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region to move to the sorted region.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
Merge Sort: A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.
Quick Sort: Another divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the partitions.
